export default function RestaurantPage() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Restaurant Stuff Here</h1>

            <p>

        On this page we could functionality to create, delete, and update
        resaurants. It would also make sense to have a link to a page from here
        manage the products that belong to a restaurant. Or maybe this should
        be on the home page as well?
